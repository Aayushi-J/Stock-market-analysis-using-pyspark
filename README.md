### Methodology Overview
The methodology for predicting stock market movements involves a two-stage machine learning approach, which integrates linear modeling and local pattern recognition. This approach is designed to leverage big data capabilities for more accurate predictions. Hereâ€™s a concise yet detailed explanation of the methodology:

### 1. **Data Collection and Preparation**
- **Historical Data:** Collect historical stock market data, which includes variables such as stock prices, trading volume, and other relevant financial indicators.
- **Data Cleaning:** Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure consistency.
- **Feature Selection:** Identify and select key features that significantly impact stock market performance.

### 2. **Stage One: Linear Modeling**
- **Model Selection:** Choose Linear Regression as the primary model for capturing general trends in the stock market data.
- **Training:** Train the Linear Regression model using the prepared historical data. This model focuses on understanding the overall market direction based on the selected features.

### 3. **Stage Two: Local Pattern Recognition**
- **Model Selection:** Choose Decision Tree as the secondary model to capture local patterns and non-linear relationships within the data.
- **Training:** Train the Decision Tree model using the residuals from the Linear Regression model. This helps in fine-tuning the predictions by recognizing more complex data patterns that the linear model might miss.

### 4. **Model Combination**
- **Stacking:** Combine the Linear Regression model and the Decision Tree model into a stacked ensemble. The predictions from the Linear Regression model are fed into the Decision Tree model, which adjusts for any discrepancies.
- **Integration:** Implement the stacked model in the XAMPP environment using Apache PySpark, ensuring efficient processing of large datasets.

### 5. **Evaluation**
- **Metric:** Evaluate the model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which measures the average magnitude of prediction errors.
- **Comparative Study:** Perform a comparative analysis of the two-stage model against other machine learning models to validate its effectiveness.
- **Results:** The study found that the Linear Regression stacked upon the Decision Tree model outperformed other combinations, indicating a robust framework for stock market prediction.
